Create the Earthquake Visualization
- Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").
- Use the URL of the selected JSON dataset for visualization.
- Use Leaflet to create a map plotting all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
- Reflect earthquake magnitude with marker size and earthquake depth with marker color.
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and those with greater depth should appear darker.
- Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Create a legend to provide context for the map data.
